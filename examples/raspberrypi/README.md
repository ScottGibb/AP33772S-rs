# Raspberry Pi Example

## Summary

This cargo project shows how to get started with the AP33772S Driver using a Raspberry Pi and the [rppal hal](https://docs.rs/rppal/latest/rppal/).

This is a simple minimal project in which it proves out that the driver can be used. For full functional examples copy the AP33772s functions and code from the [examples above](../README.md).

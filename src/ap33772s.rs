//! # AP33772S Device Driver
//!
//! This module contains the main driver implementation for the AP33772S USB-C Power Delivery controller.
//! The driver supports both interrupt-driven and delay-based communication modes.
//!
//! ## Operating Modes
//!
//! - **Delay-based** (default): Uses HAL-provided delay for timing-sensitive operations
//! - **Interrupt-based**: Uses an interrupt pin to determine when the device is ready (requires `interrupts` feature) - STILL IN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT
//!
//! ## Advanced Features
//!
//! When the `advanced` feature is enabled, users gain access to low-level register operations
//! for fine-grained control over device behavior.

/// # AP33772S USB-C Power Delivery Controller
///
/// The main driver struct for communicating with an AP33772S device over I2C.
/// This device handles USB-C Power Delivery negotiations and power management.
///
/// ## Generic Parameters
///
/// - `I2C`: I2C peripheral implementing [`embedded_hal::i2c::I2c`] (sync) or `embedded_hal_async::i2c::I2c` (async)
/// - `D`: Delay provider implementing [`embedded_hal::delay::DelayNs`] (sync) or `embedded_hal_async::delay::DelayNs` (async)
/// - `P`: (Optional, requires `interrupts` feature) Interrupt pin implementing [`embedded_hal::digital::InputPin`]
///
/// ## Usage Examples
///
/// ### Basic Synchronous Usage
///
/// ```rust
/// use ap33772s_rs::Ap33772s;
/// use ap33772s_rs::units::*;
/// # async fn example(i2c: impl embedded_hal::i2c::I2c, delay: impl embedded_hal::delay::DelayNs) -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
/// // Create and initialize with default settings

///
/// // Read device statistics
/// let stats = device.get_statistics()?;

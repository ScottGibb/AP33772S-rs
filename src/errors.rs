//! # Error Types for AP33772S Driver
//!
//! This module contains all error types that can occur when using the AP33772S driver.
//! The errors are designed to provide clear information about what went wrong and how
//! to potentially resolve the issue.
//!
//! ## Error Categories
//!
//! ### Communication Errors
//! - [`Ap33772sError::I2c`] - Low-level I2C bus communication failures
//!
//! ### Data Errors  
//! - [`Ap33772sError::ConversionFailed`] - Value conversion/scaling problems
//! - [`Ap33772sError::DataMalformed`] - Invalid data received from device
//!
//! ### Request Validation Errors
//! - [`Ap33772sError::InvalidRequest`] - Power delivery request parameter validation
//!
//! ### Device Errors
//! - [`Ap33772sError::WrongCommandVersion`] - Device not found or wrong device type
//! - [`Ap33772sError::InitialisationFailure`] - Device failed to initialize properly
//! - [`Ap33772sError::PowerDataObjectNotDetected`] - Requested PDO not available
//!
//! ## Error Handling Strategies
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use ap33772s_rs::{Ap33772sError, errors::RequestError};
//!
//! async fn handle_errors(mut device: ap33772s_rs::Ap33772s<impl embedded_hal::i2c::I2c, impl embedded_hal::delay::DelayNs>) {
//!     match device.get_status() {
//!         Ok(status) => println!("Status: {:?}", status),
//!         Err(Ap33772sError::I2c(_)) => {
//!             // I2C communication problem - check connections
//!             eprintln!("I2C communication failed - check wiring");
//!         },
//!         Err(Ap33772sError::WrongCommandVersion(version)) => {
//!             // Wrong device or device not responding
//!             eprintln!("Device not found or wrong type. Got version: 0x{:02X}", version);
//!         },
//!         Err(Ap33772sError::DataMalformed(value)) => {
//!             // Device returned unexpected data
//!             eprintln!("Device returned invalid data: 0x{:02X}", value);
//!         },
//!         Err(other) => eprintln!("Other error: {}", other),
//!     }
//! }
//! ```

/// Comprehensive error type for all AP33772S driver operations.
///
/// This enum covers all possible error conditions that can occur when communicating
/// with and controlling the AP33772S device. Each variant provides specific information
/// about the type of failure to help with debugging and error handling.
///
/// # Error Categories
///
/// ## Communication Errors
/// These errors indicate problems with the I2C communication link to the device.
///
/// ## Data Processing Errors  
/// These errors occur when data cannot be properly converted or is in an unexpected format.
///
/// ## Request Validation Errors
/// These errors are caught before sending commands to the device, indicating invalid parameters.
///
/// ## Device State Errors
/// These errors indicate problems with device detection, initialization, or capabilities.
///
/// # Error Recovery
///
/// Most errors are recoverable with appropriate action:
/// - **I2C errors**: Check wiring, power, and bus configuration
/// - **Conversion errors**: Verify parameter ranges and units  
/// - **Invalid requests**: Adjust parameters within valid ranges
/// - **Device errors**: Power cycle device or check connections

    /// This error indicates a low-level problem with the I2C communication link
    /// to the AP33772S device. It wraps the embedded-hal I2C error type.
    ///
    /// # Common Causes
    /// - **No device response**: Device not powered or not connected
    /// - **Bus arbitration loss**: Multiple masters on the I2C bus
    /// - **NACK response**: Device busy or address not recognized  
    /// - **Bus errors**: Short circuits, incorrect pull-ups, electrical noise
    ///
    /// # Recovery Actions
    /// - Verify device power supply (3.3V or 5V)
    /// - Check I2C wiring (SDA, SCL, GND connections)
    /// - Verify pull-up resistors (typically 4.7kÎ©)
    /// - Check for bus conflicts with other devices

    /// - Check parameter values against device specifications

    ///
    /// # Common Causes
    /// - **Reserved bits set**: Device using newer firmware with different bit meanings
    /// - **Communication corruption**: Noise causing bit errors
    /// - **Device malfunction**: Internal device error or undefined state
    /// - **Timing issues**: Reading registers during state transitions
    ///
    /// # Debugging

    /// # Device Address
    /// The AP33772S uses I2C address 0x51 (7-bit) or 0xA2/0xA3 (8-bit read/write).

    /// # Debugging
    /// The contained `u8` value shows what was read from the command version

    /// # Recovery Actions
    /// - Verify correct I2C address configuration
    /// - Check device power and reset signals

    /// Device initialization failure.

    /// This error indicates that the AP33772S failed to initialize properly
    /// during the startup sequence. This can happen if the device is already
    /// initialized, powered incorrectly, or has internal faults.
    ///
    /// # Common Causes
    /// - **Already initialized**: Device was previously configured and is running
    /// - **Incorrect power sequencing**: Device powered before proper initialization
    /// - **Hardware faults**: Internal device problems
    /// - **Timing violations**: Not waiting for device boot sequence
    ///
    /// # Recovery Actions
    /// - Perform hard reset of the device
    /// - Power cycle both device and any connected USB-C devices
    /// - Verify power supply stability during startup
    /// - Check for proper boot timing delays
    /// - If using RotoPD board, disconnect both Stemma connector and USB-C device
    ///
    /// # Initialization Sequence
    /// Proper initialization requires:
    /// 1. Device power-on
    /// 2. Wait for internal boot sequence (typically 100ms)
    /// 3. Check device presence and version
    /// 4. Configure thermal resistances and thresholds
    /// 5. Enable desired power delivery modes

    ///
    /// This error occurs when attempting to negotiate with a Power Data Object (PDO)

    /// # Common Causes
    /// - **PDO not supported**: Source doesn't offer the requested power level
    /// - **Cable limitations**: Cable cannot support requested power (especially EPR)
    /// - **Source limitations**: Source doesn't support advanced PD features
    /// - **Stale capabilities**: Source capabilities changed since last query
    ///
    /// # Prevention
    /// Always check available capabilities before making requests:
    /// 1. Call [`get_all_source_power_capabilities`]
    /// 2. Verify the desired PDO is present and valid
    /// 3. Check PDO type and capabilities match requirements
    /// 4. Use appropriate fallback PDOs if primary choice unavailable
    ///
    /// # Recovery Actions
    /// - Query current source capabilities
    /// - Select from available PDOs
    /// - Check cable and source specifications
    /// - Consider using lower power PDOs as fallback

    /// # Common Scenarios
    /// - **Variable PDOs**: Voltage selection parameter is required but was `None`
    /// - **PPS/AVS PDOs**: Voltage must be specified within the adjustable range
    /// - **Battery PDOs**: Power specification may be required

    /// The driver checks that:

    /// - **Wrong PDO**: Selected wrong PDO for desired voltage
    /// - **Unit confusion**: Volts vs millivolts mix-up
    ///
    /// # Resolution
    /// 1. Get PDO voltage range: `pdo.get_min_voltage()` and `pdo.get_max_voltage()`
    /// 2. Adjust requested voltage to be within range
    /// 3. Or select a different PDO that supports the desired voltage
    ///

    /// - **PPS PDO**: Might support 3.3V - 21V adjustable

    /// # Current Validation
    /// The driver checks that:
    /// ```text
    /// requested_current â¤ PDO.max_current
    /// ```
    ///
    /// # Common Causes
    /// - **Overestimating capacity**: Requesting more current than PDO supports
    /// - **Wrong PDO selection**: Selected low-power PDO for high-power application
    /// - **Cable limitations**: Cable cannot support requested current (especially >3A)
    /// - **Source limitations**: Source hardware cannot provide requested current
    ///
    /// # Resolution
    /// 1. Check PDO current capability: `pdo.get_max_current()`
    /// 2. Reduce requested current to within limits
    /// 3. Select higher-power PDO if available
    /// 4. Verify cable rating for high-current operation (>3A requires 5A cable)

    /// # Current Considerations
    /// - **Standard USB-C cables**: Limited to 3A maximum
    /// - **5A rated cables**: Required for >3A operation (electronically marked)
